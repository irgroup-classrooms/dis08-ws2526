## Fictional Bio:
Hi! I’m Alex, a curious developer who enjoys learning how tools work under the hood.  
I’m currently practicing Git workflows like branching, merging, and conflict resolution.  
Outside coding, I like reading sci-fi and taking long walks while listening to podcasts.  
My current goal is to become faster and more confident working in the terminal.
