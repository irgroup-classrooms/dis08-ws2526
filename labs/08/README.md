# Data Science Packages

> [!NOTE]
> In this exercise, you will practice applying descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to a real-world dataset. The goal is to strengthen your understanding of the methods learned today and prepare for upcoming assignments on *hypothesis testing* and *machine learning*.
> 
> You may select a dataset from the options below (**at least one is required**). Consider reusing the same dataset for later assignments to build continuity in your analysis. The [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) is an excellent resource for additional datasets if you’d like to explore further.
