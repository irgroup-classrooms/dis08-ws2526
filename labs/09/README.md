# Hypothesis Testing

> [!NOTE]
> To reinforce the concepts you have learned today, you will conduct a t-test on a real-world dataset. This exercise will help you practice selecting the appropriate type of t-test and interpreting the results in the context of your data. You may reuse the dataset from the previous assignment or choose a new one. Remember the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) is a great source for datasets. A pre-selection of candidates is provided below.
> 
> **Task Instructions**
> 1.	Select a dataset (**at least one**).
> 2.	Identify suitable samples within the dataset that allow you to test a meaningful hypothesis using a t-test.
> 3.	Decide which type of t-test is appropriate (e.g., one-sample, independent two-sample, or paired).
> 4.	Implement the t-test in Python.
> 5.	Interpret and explain the results clearly, linking them back to your hypothesis.
